## Introduction



joke about finding a complicated historical link with finance: Dutch concept, tulip bubble. 

DIstributed by Endemol in the US and Canada as well as in France.

Explain the concept: N boxes with prizes, screen showing them. R rounds, each round r open N_r boxes one by one. At the end of each round, the banker makes a cash offer. If the player accepts the offer, they pockt the cash and the game ends. If they refuse, they move to the next round and repeat the procedure until there are only two prizes in play. In fact, N_r is strictly decreasing, and is actually constant equal to one after a certain number of rounds. Therefore, at the last round, round R, there are only two prizes left in play. One in the panel, and the player's box. If the offer made by the banker is refused, the player pockets the amount of cash that there is in his own box.

Entertaining show (some note on the audience), but some point might seem strange. It is clear that any offer made by the banker must stand in the interval. We will refer to such an offer as an admissible offer



 At round R, there are only two prices left. But if the player has the lowest one, any admissible offer makes the banker pay a highest amount than what we would have had to pay without intervention.  This type of offer is systematic in the rules of game, the banker HAS to make it. In fact, it would be weird to imagine such an offer being opitional. If we know the banker only makes an offer when it is in his favour, a rational player would never accept it as they would deduce that they have a higher. The offer at round R is mandatory, so why would the banker accept to lose money this in this case ?

A first explanation could be because this is a TV show, suspense. In this case suspense means variance. Yet, it is in the interest of the prod to minimize too high losses. A more satisfactory answer is to see the difference between the banker's offer and the one they accept in this case as a premium the banker's pay to purchase the right of bluffing.
